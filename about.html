Along with their experienced bakers, they have expanded Patricia’s dream and have seen it flourish.</p>

<p>Because of the Hanson family’s dedication to quality and excellence, The Rolling Pin has received national recognition. Master Baker Sally has been featured in numerous publications, such as Modern Bride, and The Knot. The Today’s Show viewers voted Sally’s cake design as best cake in America. She has also appeared in many other media outlets, including multiple appearances on the Food Network, for her intricate sugar art design specialty cakes and wedding cakes that look just as good as they taste.</p>
        
<p>Sally uses what she learned from her mother and has taken her skills and artistry to new heights. Every cake made is customized to the individual’s needs and desires. Hundreds of thank you notes from satisfied brides and customers are available for you to review. Even Channel Seven’s Bill Evans said, “The best bakery in New Orleans, Ottawa.”
